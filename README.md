# MILES-SA

Mixed Integer Linear Energy Storage (MILES) is a project that aims to address the question of "how much energy storage does South Australia (SA) need to be 100% renewable".

See [] for the published version of the paper.

## Project
MILES uses mixed integer linear programming to determine the storage requirement for SA based on publicly provided data from the Australia Energy Market Operator.

The code provided in this repository is the source code used to develop the results presented in the accompanying paper.
